Dm                 F     C     Dm              F      C
  Tin soldiers and Nixon coming, we're finally on our own
Dm              F        C       Dm             F  C
  This summer I hear the drumming, four dead in Ohio
 
 
[Verse]
 
Gm7                    C
   Gotta get down to it, soldiers are gunning us down
Gm7                            C
   Should have been done long ago
Gm7                        C
   What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground
Gm7                          C
   How can you run when you know?

  La lalala  la la la la   la lalala  la la la
