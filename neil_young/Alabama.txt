Oh  Alabama; the devil fools with the best laid plan.

F      G      Em

 Swing low Alabama

F                         D

 You got the spare change,  you got to feel strange

E                   F            G

 And now the moment  is all that it meant.

 

Am                   Am7            Am

Alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders

       C             D

That's breaking your back.

     Am                 Am7          Am

Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch

      C            D

And a wheel on the track

 

F G    Em   F        G                   F      C

Oh  Alabama,  banjos playing through the broken glass

F        G       Em

 Windows down in Alabama.

F                   D

  See the old folks  tied in white ropes

E                 F                  G

  Hear the banjo;  don't it take you down home?

 

Am                   Am7            Am

Alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders

       C             D

That's breaking your back.

     Am                 Am7          Am

Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch

      C            D

And a wheel on the track

 

F G    Em    F      G           F          C

Oh  Alabama;  can I see you and shake your hand.

F     G               Em

 Make friends down in Alabama.

F

 I'm from a new land

D                  E

 I come to you and  see all this ruin 

F            G

What are you doin'? 

 

Am

Alabama,

            Am7         Am       C         D

You got the rest of the union to help you along

       Am          F G Em

What's goin' wrong?
